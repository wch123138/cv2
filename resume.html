<h1>Bill's Resume</h1>
<p>A friendly and independent college student. I like to enjoy life and study. I studied IT knowledge in university for three years. I have mastered a lot of IT software knowledge, such as Photoshop, AE and PR. </p>
<p>In school, my three favorite subjects are English class, PE class and English class. I can exercise in PE class. In English class, I can better relate to spoken English. In music class, I can enjoy listening to music.  </p>
<p>I like to watch some action movies, so I'm good at editing the best parts of action movies together. My disadvantage is that my English is not very good, because my understanding of English is poor. But I will try my best to overcome my shortcomings. I usually listen to more English reports and do some English practice. Then I add English subtitles when editing to improve my English and editing skills.  </p>
